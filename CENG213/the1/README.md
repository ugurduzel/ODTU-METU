In this school project, I implemented a playlist editor by firstly implementing generic singuly linked lists and stacks. Editing the playlist is possible by inserting/deleting an entry, moving an entry to left or right, reversing the list, sorting the list or shuffle the list. Also merging two playlist entries is also possible. The playlist editor has also a limited UNDO capability which will be able to undo insert, delete and reverse operations. Please see the pdf for details.
